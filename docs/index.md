## What is Netlify?

Netlify is the fastest way to build the fastest web sites using the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org) approach.

Millions of developers and businesses use Netlify to run web projects on a global scale &mdash; without servers, devops, or costly infrastructure. After building your site, Netlify pushes your files to its global CDN for nearly instantaneous access anywhere on the planet.

Best of all, you can get started in seconds for free.
